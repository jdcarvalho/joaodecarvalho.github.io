# Proof of Concept: 2FA in Django with TOTP

---

### üîí Introduction

[The otpauth repository](https://github.com/jdcarvalho/otpauth) is a proof of concept (POC) that demonstrates how to integrate Two‚ÄëFactor Authentication (2FA) using Time‚Äëbased One‚ÄëTime Passwords (TOTP) into a Django application.

It leverages the `pyotp` library to generate and verify time-bound OTPs, providing an extra layer of security on top of the traditional username/password login flow. The project also customizes the Django admin interface to manage 2FA settings, making it easy to integrate into existing Django apps ‚Äî especially admin panels or internal tools that need additional protection.

---

### üìÅ Project Structure

The repository includes the following components:

- `otpauth/`: Django app containing models, views, forms, and core logic for OTP integration.
- `custom_admin/`: Admin customizations to manage OTP settings and enable 2FA per user.
- `templates/`: HTML pages for OTP enrollment, QR code display, and verification.
- `manage.py` & `requirements.txt`: Typical Django project files and dependencies.

### ‚úÖ Setup Instructions

To run the POC locally:

1. Create a virtual environment (Python 3.x recommended)
2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run migrations and create a superuser:

    ```bash
    ./manage.py makemigrations
    ./manage.py migrate
    ./manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    ./manage.py runserver
    ```

5. Access Django Admin at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`, enable 2FA for a user, and log in to test OTP flows.

### üß© Core Components

- **pyotp Integration**: The `pyotp` library is used to generate and validate TOTP codes using a shared secret between the server and the user‚Äôs authenticator app.

- **Secret Generation & Storage**:
  - A random base32 secret is generated using `pyotp.random_base32()`
  - The secret is securely stored in the user profile or a dedicated OTP model
  - A QR code is generated and rendered via templates to simplify enrollment with apps like Google Authenticator or Authy

### üîß Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

This POC can be extended with the following improvements for real-world use:

- Add backup codes for recovery
- Enforce OTP validation across all login endpoints using middleware
- Integrate support for WebAuthn or hardware-based tokens
- Secure the QR code endpoint with permissions or CSRF protection

### üõ°Ô∏è Disclaimer

This implementation is intended as a learning resource and starting point. Additional hardening is required before deploying it in production environments, such as rate-limiting login attempts and encrypting stored secrets.
